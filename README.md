## This project is a multithreaded client-server chat application built in Java using sockets and threads. The ChatServer listens for incoming connections and creates a dedicated thread for each connected client, enabling simultaneous messaging between multiple users in real-time. Each ChatClient connects to the server and communicates independently through its own thread, allowing users to send and receive messages concurrently. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Java networking and multithreading and is ideal for showcasing real-time communication, concurrency control, and socket programming skills in standalone desktop applications.
